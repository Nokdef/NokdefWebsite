# So, who is this *"Nokdef"* guy anyway?

Hello World. 

It feels quite pretentious writing about myself on a website that is quintessentially about technical topics, but I do feel entitled to a few paragraphs on the spotlight for all my effort.

I'm a 22-year-old Brazilian Technical Artist that wants to spread my knowledge around. I stumbled on game development through Valve's modding community and have managed to monetized my hobby through shaders and visual effects. 

My main endeavor right now - aside from my regular work at Deck Nine - is to make the best free course on technical art on the internet. So far, I haven't got much to show for it, aside from a bunch of scripts that have yet to be released, but the end-goal is to have a course that makes you employable by the end of it. 

Sure, it won't cover the nitty-gritty of HLSL or the depths of rendering engineering, but just enough to make you employable as a junior in the industry. Basic *maths*, node based shaders and so on.

In the meantime, I'll try to update my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/nokdef) channel and this website with more topical tutorials on how to achieve certain technical feats on either Unreal or Unity.

I also make a bunch of Unity assets that I sell on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/48767), so you can get some high quality effects there from yours truly.

Thanks for reading!  :grin:
